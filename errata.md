# Errata for *Practical Quantum Computing for Developers*

***Chapter 1*

Page 11 - "Thus now we observe the light to spread..." should be "Thus now we observe the light spreading to become…”

Page 12 - "...expect there to see..." should be "...expect there to be..."

Page 13 - "...he thought will be..." should be "...he thought there would be..."

Page 14 - This is not a typo, but the first sentence of the 2nd paragraph begs a quote or reference. 

Page 14 - "...dice was Einstein..." should be "...dice was Einstein's..."

Page 15 - "...believed on the idea..." should be "...believed in the idea..."

***Chapter 2* 

Page 30 - "Figure 4" should be "Figure 2-4"

Page 31 - Would benefit with explanation of Capital-pi (Cartesian product?), definition of "x", how to handle the units of "h" mathematically 

Page 42 - In the Tip box the word "faith" should be "fate" 

Page 51 - Isn't absolute zero -273.15 deg. C instead of -271?

Page 75 - The table at the top of page 75 lists the average temperature of Earth (surface temperature) as 58 degrees Celsius. The author has added the following citation to support this statistic: https://www.space.com/17816-earth-temperature.html

***Chapter 3*

Page 83 - "...much interesting..." should be "...much more interesting..."

Page 91 - I suggest to clarify if "correlated" means "perfectly correlated" in the last paragraph

Page 99 - Not a typo, but regarding "religious dogma", many people would say the opposite - a lack of free will = no choice between right/wrong = no good/evil = an invalidation of all major religions

Page 101 - "...getting it on the action." should be "...getting in on the action."

***Chapter 4*

Page 153 - "Some the quantum gates..." should be "Some of the quantum gates..."

***Chapter 5*

Page 196 - "...1 > 1/2..." should be  "...1, i.e. > 1/2..." 

Page 197 - Line numbers should be printed as they are referenced in the preceeding text.
